# TODO: Update Organization Info and Hero Section

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Update `useOrganizationInfo.js` to fetch additional numeric fields from the API (e.g., doctors_count, patients_count, success_rate, years_experience, emergency_phone).
- [ ] Modify `HeroSection.jsx` to import and use the `useOrganizationInfo` hook, replacing hardcoded stats and phone numbers with dynamic data from the hook.
- [ ] Ensure login state is properly managed to prevent redirect to login page after authentication.
- [ ] Test the changes to verify data loads correctly and UI updates dynamically.
